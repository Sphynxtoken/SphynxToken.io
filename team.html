            <h2 style="text-align: start; font-size: 26px; font-weight: bold;">Thought Experiments (Galaxy brains only)</h2>
            <p>Who are easily convinced to put money into coins? <br>Non experienced investors chasing microcaps and
                obvious pump and dumps and who are not "maximalists" in any one crypto currency. <br>Aka the users of BSC
            </p>
            <p>
                Who shills the most in all of cryptocurrencies?<br> Shitcoin Investors There are hundreds of thousands of
                them, sending millions of messages a day shilling their bags. They all control a seemingly unlimited
                supply of $20 bills and have adopted the strategy
                of throwing shit ($20) against the wall (unlimited supply of shitcoins) to see what sticks (goes up in
                price)
            </p>
            <p>
                What would happen if we show these guys amazing price performance and not -99% losses?<br> They will look
                deeper. That is where we have the chance to convert these people into Hexicans. What would happen if we
                combine their connections into Shitcoin communities
                and shilling power with our amazing products? It may seem unorthodox to some, but we believe it could be
                a winning strategy to market and acquire more investors… Please spend more than a few seconds thinking
                about this... We would have
                successfully infiltrated our gatekeeping enemy (BSC). Once these people wake up and acquire more
                knowledge about the garbage in crypto, CZ’s soldiers will defect to the Hexican army and continue to
                spread the word This will greatly accelerate
                the growth and adoption of the things we care about leading up to the launch of Pulse chain and beyond.
                Critical mass will be achieved sooner. Prices will rise faster. $ value of sacrifices could be greater.
            </p>
            <p>
                All crypto that will be sacrificed to pulse will essentially be “sent to crypto heaven” We are confident
                that all the hex sacrificed will not be sold on the market. Maybe we could assume the the creator of
                pulse chain is not motivated by profit and that
                none of the sacrificed tokens will be sold on the market. Maybe Pulse will allow Sphynx to be sacrificed
                so the new holders interested in participating don't have to sell their Sphynx for BSC to achieve the
                same goal. This would protect
                the price. If this is done SPX would have the most attractive price chart out of all tokens built upon
                BSC.
            </p>
            <p>
                We could potentially onboard tens of thousands more active users into Pulse from the get go. Maybe there
                was a delay between when the decision to allow Sphynx to be sacrificed is made and when it is publicly
                announced. This would create an exponential
                look to the price chart as word is spread around. Maybe there is no public announcement, maybe it just
                shows up on the list that could be sacrificed….Surprise…. Whatever happens, your speculation and
                contribution will accelerate the growth
                of everything. The mission will continue regardless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why attach our real faces and identities to this potentially controversial at this stage?. There will come a time where we could
                jump on a livestream and could openly discuss specifics for hours and hours, but that time is not now.
                We must focus on the tasks at hand and If this
                concept is rejected by the community then no harm is done, there will not be a face or a name behind the
                slander, we will not be looked down upon by others when recognized and we will on continue as normal (up
                into the right). If this
                idea is accepted our projects will be developed quicker and we will have the support behind them so that
                they work as intended, that would be the time when all will be revealed. Praise will gladly be received
                as we would have successfully
                made prices go up into the right harder and faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                We think it would be fun for the community to speculate who we are as it encourages the use of your
                galaxy brain. See if you can spot any clues around our site. Are we active members of the community? Are
                we streamers, content creators or Telegram admins?
                Did we attend the Vegas meetup? Has anything been said within the thousands of hours of live streams
                that might give away our identities? Maybe there are things hidden within the code of the website? If
                someone does guess right, up until
                the point that all is revealed you would not know for sure. Keep the game going for a while. If people
                think you are behind this, why confirm or deny? just laugh and redirect them to other clues.
            </p>
            <p>
                We think reading through our website and speculating on who is behind it would make for some great
                content. Once your galaxy brain has been stimulated, direct that power into understanding the potential
                of this idea. Have a think to yourself about
                what you would like to see happen within our developing ecosystem and how you can help? Type it up and
                send it here <a href="mailto:sphynxideas@protonmail.com">sphynxideas@protonmail.com</a>  you might be onto something great. People die, communities do
                not.
            </p>

                “it would be nice if people could show off how awesome they were with stuff that is not watches so they
                don't have to waste their money on non productive assets". Sphynx solves this! although not being a
                material, holding Sphynx tokens could be a form
                of social signaling within the community, it could help determine the addresses that want the best for
                the ecosystem. Large amount of Pulse or Hex combined with some Sphynx means whoever owns the address
                supports the ecosystem more than
                someone without. Those who hold sphynx would be unlikely to dump their coins and likely to hold for
                longer than someone without any. Those who hold Sphynx will make gains as the network and our projects
                gain traction. More coins bought
                and burnt, Less supply more demand. Imagine a competition between whales, He / She who has the more sphynx
                believes in / supports our ecosystem more than a whale with less.
